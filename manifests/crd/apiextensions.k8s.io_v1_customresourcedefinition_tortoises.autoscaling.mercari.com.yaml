                description: "AutoscalingPolicy is an optional field for specifying the scaling approach for each resource within each container. \n There are two primary options for configuring resource scaling within containers: 1. Allow Tortoise to automatically determine the appropriate autoscaling policy for each resource. 2. Manually define the autoscaling policy for each resource. \n For the first option, simply leave this field unset. In this case, Tortoise will adjust the autoscaling policies using the following rules: - If .spec.TargetRefs.HorizontalPodAutoscalerName is not provided, the policies default to \"Horizontal\" for CPU and \"Vertical\" for memory across all containers. - If .spec.TargetRefs.HorizontalPodAutoscalerName is specified, resources governed by the referenced Horizontal Pod Autoscaler will use a \"Horizontal\" policy, while those not managed by the HPA will use a \"Vertical\" policy. Note that Tortoise supports only the ContainerResource metric type for HPAs; other metric types will be disregarded. Additionally, if a ContainerResource metric is later added to an HPA associated with Tortoise, Tortoise will automatically update relevant resources to utilize a \"Horizontal\" policy. - if a container doesn't have the resource request, that container's autoscaling policy is always set to \"Off\" because tortoise cannot generate any recommendation without the resource request. \n With the second option, you must manually specify the AutoscalingPolicy for the resources of each container within this field. If policies are defined for some but not all containers or resources, Tortoise will assign a default \"Off\" policy to unspecified resources. Be aware that when new containers are introduced to the workload, the AutoscalingPolicy configuration must be manually updated, as Tortoise will default to an \"Off\" policy for resources within the new container, preventing scaling. \n The AutoscalingPolicy field is mutable; you can modify it at any time, whether from an empty state to populated or vice versa."
