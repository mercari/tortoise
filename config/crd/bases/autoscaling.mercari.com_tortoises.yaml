                                calculated by the tortoise. If AutoscalingPolicy is
                                vertical, it's the same value as the VPA suggests.
                                If AutoscalingPolicy is horizontal, it's basically
                                the same value as the current resource request. But,
                                when the number of replicas are too small or too large,
                                tortoise may try to increase/decrease the amount of
                                resources given to the container, so that the number
                                of replicas won't be very small or very large.
